# Django-React-Gallery

Photo/maybe Video gallery using many to many fields - still ugly as there is no css yet.

Pretty sure there is an easier way to do this, rather than having multiple serializers for the same model but it works.

Also set up ready for alerts and authentication.

I will probably update this to be an accordian slider, maybe get fancy with it.
