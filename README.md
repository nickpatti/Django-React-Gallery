# Django-React-Gallery

Photo/maybe Video gallery using many to many fields - still ugly as there is no css yet. This is mainly just a shortcut for me so I don't have to worry about making a new photo gallery for every client I have.

Pretty sure there is an easier way to do this, rather than having multiple serializers for the same model but it works.

Also set up ready for alerts and authentication.

I will probably update this to be an accordian slider, maybe get fancy with it.
